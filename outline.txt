When the server is created, make a table object and find a way to pass it to every client that connects to the server so that they are connected to the shared resource

after every connection accepted, add the client to a playing queue and increment a players var
if the value of players is over 4, add the players to the waiting queue.
send message to all players asking to ready, send message to queue players if exists, that waiting
server each client, if say bye, disconnect them and pop from waiting queue if any and push to playing queue
    if say ready, move to next client
    if say anything else, loop until either "bye" or "ready"

call deal on the table and serve to each client and server until everyone has 2 cards



before initial while loop of client and server, server make the table and pass it to the object buffer for all clients to get and use
